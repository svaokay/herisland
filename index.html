            <h1>Welcome to Eluriah!</h1>
            <p>hello! this is my first website,
                made in order to share all kinds of stuff about my visual novel,
                including the download, only when i will finish it!
            a visual novel game based on a particular view on existence and reality,
             that takes the story of a girl with a messed up mind and lets her find out
             the truth about the universe.
             three primordial creatures and a curiosity about what reality would be like,
             if experienced through the eyes of a mind unaware of the truth of existence
             the three creatures decide to create a new world.
             in a world where exors, powers born from the deepest experiences of a person,
            are secretely changing humanity, Swanpi is a silent child, excluded from others
            and unable to awaken her gift.
            but under the promise of a "better place", her father, the brilliant but dark
            scientist Takeno Aiden, drags her to a secret laboratory suspended in the sky.</p>
